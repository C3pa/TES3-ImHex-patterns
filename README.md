# ImHex Pattern files for TES3 Morrowind

These are pattern files to be used with [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/) to inspect Morrowind's esm, esp, ess and bsa files. These are based on the similar [patterns by Greatness7](https://github.com/Greatness7/binary_templates) for 010 Editor.

## Using

Start ImHex. You'll need to add the folder where you cloned/downloaded this repository to your includes. To do so, once in ImHex, go to `Extras > Settings > Folders`. Once there add the folder to your list of included folders (this is a one-time process). This will allow ImHex to pick up the correct include paths used in these patterns. 

Now you are ready to open some of the Morrowind's files. Go to `File > Open File...`, and open `Tribunal.esm`. Then you'll get the main view of the hex editor. Then, open the pattern for your file type: `File > Import... > Pattern File`. You'll get a Choose file window. Press `Browse...` and then open the correct pattern file from the folder you cloned/downloaded this repository.

## Credits

Thanks to [Greatness7](https://github.com/Greatness7) for his [binary_templates](https://github.com/Greatness7/binary_templates) on which these are based on.
